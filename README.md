## 📌 What is Warzone Cheat?

**Warzone Cheat** is a modular, high-performance cheat framework designed to explore the inner workings of Warzone. This project dissects key game systems to show how player inputs, memory values, and rendering pipelines can be intercepted or manipulated to enhance gameplay visibility and targeting mechanics.

Whether you're interested in building game enhancement software, understanding low-level memory access, or learning more about anti-cheat bypass mechanisms, this cheat suite provides a complete sandbox environment to study those concepts.

## 🧠 Why This Project?

**Call of Duty: Warzone** remains one of the most competitive and fast-paced shooters today. With a huge player base and constant updates, the game provides an excellent playground for reverse engineering and memory mapping. This cheat project:
- Shows how external and internal cheats operate
- Demonstrates low-level input emulation and memory editing
- Offers insights into bypassing anti-cheat systems (theory only)
- Provides educational exposure to game security vulnerabilities

## 🎯 Features Breakdown

---

### 🔥 Aimbot

The **Aimbot** is the crown jewel of the Warzone cheat system. It provides:
- **Head/Neck/Chest targeting modes**
- **FOV (Field of View) adjustment** for legit or rage modes
- **Smooth aiming** to mimic natural player movement
- **Visibility checks** to avoid targeting through solid objects
- **Bone scanning** to identify optimal hit points

**Implementation Notes:**
- Reads player positions directly from memory
- Calculates angles between the player's crosshair and enemy positions
- Moves mouse input using low-level WinAPI or simulated HID inputs

---

### 👁️ ESP (Extra Sensory Perception)

The **ESP module** provides visual overlays of enemy data, allowing players to "see" behind walls, terrain, and fog. Features include:
- **Box ESP** – Draws a box around enemy players
- **Health ESP** – Displays a health bar over enemies
- **Name & Distance ESP** – Shows player names and their distance
- **Item ESP** – Highlights loot, weapons, and special gear

**Highlights:**
- Uses external overlays that are undetected by basic anti-cheats
- Color customization for team/enemy differentiation
- Supports performance-optimized rendering with DirectX hooks

---

### 🧱 Wallhack

The **Wallhack** component directly manipulates rendering logic or uses memory data to draw enemy players even when they’re behind walls. Unlike ESP, which draws on top of the game, Wallhack can:
- Render characters through walls by modifying shaders (internal)
- Provide X-ray-style vision (external overlay mode)
- Blend seamlessly with the HUD/UI to avoid suspicion

**Modes:**
- Transparent shader override (internal only)
- Highlight bounding boxes with occlusion bypass

---

### 🔫 Triggerbot

The **Triggerbot** is a rapid-fire automation system that detects when an enemy is under the crosshair and fires automatically. It ensures:
- Instant shooting upon aim detection
- Configurable delay to mimic human reflexes
- Optional ADS (Aim Down Sight) check

**Technical Highlights:**
- Raycast simulation from crosshair
- Uses color-pixel scanning or hitbox alignment
- Operates silently and only triggers in combat zones

---

### 🔄 No Recoil

Tired of controlling spray patterns? The **No Recoil** module handles that for you:
- Dynamically adjusts mouse movement to negate recoil
- Supports custom weapon profiles
- Toggleable hotkey for legit or rage mode

**How it Works:**
- Hooks into mouse input system
- Applies inverse Y-axis movement based on recoil pattern
- Offers near-zero deviation from crosshair

---

## 🔧 Configuration and Setup

### Prerequisites
- Windows 11 (or 10)
- Visual Studio 2022
